Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people all over the world. 
It can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and vision loss, if left untreated.[1]
Before the advent of technology, hypertension patients primarily monitored their health by measuring their blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. 
They typically recorded their blood pressure readings in a notebook or on paper charts to share with their healthcare provider during their periodic appointments. 
In order to adhere to lifestyle modifications such as reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight to manage hypertension, they would track their progress by keeping a diary of their exercise and diet habits, weight, and blood pressure readings. 
Additionally, patients were advised to take their medication as prescribed by their healthcare provider. They would often use pill organizers or timers to help them remember to take their medication at the appropriate times[2].
Studies show that end-user applications can be an effective way in self-management of hypertension. 
Study by Kumar et al, highlights the benefits of using smart-phone based applications for hypertension management[3].
Studies by Omboni et. al.[4] suggest that mobile applications can improve the quality of care and more effectively prevent cardiovascular consequences of hypertension.
